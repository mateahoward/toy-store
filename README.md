# Toy Store Landing Page

This landing page has been inspired by Midjourney AI designs and it represents a very simple SPA.

It contains content pages such as 'Home' and 'About' but it also shows off a 'Contact' page with a basic contact form.

## To make this project I used:

- Vue 3.2.45
- Vite 4.0.0

As this is just an SPA - there was no need for Vue Router or Vuex/Pinia.
